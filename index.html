<h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>Hey, my name is Jenny O'Bryant. Currently, I'm taking a full stack of web development in Lambda school, and I'm a cosmetic scientist now.
    My career goal for next 2-4 years is to grow and become as software engineer, so I am excited to apply because I feel I am a good fit for this position
    Six months ago, I have the opportunity to make my own website.  During the time, I gained the knowledge about how to create website by plain html and css.
    And now, I am having opportunity to fine-tune my skills from Lambda school, because I am working 2-3 projects per week.  I work well with these projects.
    I am teachable and would love to learn.  I hope you know by now that I have enthusiasm and passion for what I am doing and would love to be grow.
      </p>
